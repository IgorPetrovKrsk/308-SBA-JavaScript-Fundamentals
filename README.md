A simple JavaScript application is used to process data about student assignments.

Application work is divided into several steps
1) Checking if input data is correct. The ID of AssignmentGroup and CourseInfo are the same. Then check if all the data inside the object are correct. That includes checking for correct date formats, integer formats  and logical errors such as score cannot be higher then maximum points.
2) Deleting irrelevant data, such as assignments that are not due yet.
3) Processing the data to match the desired output format.
4) Calculating the average result of the student.
5) Deleting unnecessary dates.
6) Output.
